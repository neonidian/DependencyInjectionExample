# Dependency Injection with C#

Dependency injection is a design pattern to achieve [Inversion of Control(IoC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion) where an object supplies dependencies for another object by making use of interfaces. This makes the application loosely coupled
and enables easier maintenance.

### Running this program

1. Install [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). Verify the installation by opening the command line and typing `dotnet --version`. Executing this command must output a version of dotnet.
2. In the command line, go to the location of this project. E.g. in Linux if this project is in the home directory, type `cd $HOME/DependencyInjectionExample` and press Enter key.
3. Execute the command - `dotnet run` to execute the program and view the output in console.
